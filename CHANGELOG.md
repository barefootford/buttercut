# Changelog

All notable changes to ButterCut will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.0] - 2025-12-01

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Simplified library.yaml transcript fields
  - `transcript_path` → `transcript` (filename only, not full path)
  - `visual_transcript_path` → `visual_transcript` (filename only, not full path)
  - Transcripts are always stored in `libraries/[library-name]/transcripts/`
  - Reduces library.yaml size by ~45% for large libraries
- **Hundredths-of-second timestamp precision** in roughcuts
  - Timestamps now use `HH:MM:SS.ss` format instead of `HH:MM:SS`
  - Preserves timing within ~10ms of WhisperX transcript data
  - Prevents clipping words at edit points

### Removed
- `file_size_mb` field from library.yaml (not used for editorial decisions)

### Migration
```bash
# Back up your libraries first (creates ZIP in /backups/)
ruby .claude/skills/backup-library/backup_libraries.rb

# Migrate library.yaml files to new field names
ruby scripts/001_migrate_0.2_to_0.3.rb --all
```

## [0.2.0] - 2025-11-25

### Added
- **backup-library skill**: Creates compressed ZIP backups of libraries (transcripts, roughcuts, YAML - not video files)
- **update-buttercut skill**: Automatically downloads and installs the latest version while preserving libraries
- **Flexible setup options**: Simple mise-based install for beginners, advanced checklist for developers
- `.ruby-version` and `.python-version` files for broad version manager support (rbenv, pyenv, asdf, etc.)
- Install location check to warn about problematic directories
- Manual installation documentation at `docs/installation.md`

### Changed
- Restructured setup skill with separate `simple-setup.md` and `advanced-setup.md` guides
- Moved roughcut generation to subtask for streamlined workflow
- Improved Homebrew installation messaging (needs interactive terminal for password prompts)
- Added libyaml dependency to prevent psych extension build failures
- Added note about Ruby compilation time (5-10 minutes via mise)

## [0.1.1] - 2025-01-21

### Added
- DaVinci Resolve support via FCP7 XML (xmeml version 5) format
- Release skill for automated version management and publishing workflow
- Centralized version management via `ButterCut::VERSION` constant

### Changed
- Improved library management with better documentation and workflow guidelines
- Enhanced CLAUDE.md with clearer library setup and parallel transcription patterns

### Fixed
- Gemspec now references version from `lib/buttercut/version.rb` for single source of truth

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-15

### Added
- Initial release of ButterCut gem

  - `analyze-video`: Frame extraction and visual analysis
  - `roughcut`: AI-powered rough cut and sequence creation
- Library-based project management system
- Comprehensive test suite with 65+ specs
